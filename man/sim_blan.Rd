\description{
Simulation of Blanchard Bubble
}
\details{
Blanchard's Bubble process has two regimes, which occur with probability \eqn{\pi} and \eqn{1-\pi}.
In the first regime, the bubble grows expontentially at the rate \eqn{(1+r)\pi}, whereas in the
second regime, the bubble collapses to a white noise.

With probability \eqn{\pi}
\deqn{B_{t+1} = \frac{1+r}{\pi}B_t+\epsilon_{t+1}}{B[t+1]=(1+r)/\pi*B[t]+\epsilon[t+1]}
With probability \eqn{\pi}
\deqn{B_{t+1} = \epsilon_{t+1}}{B[t+1] = \epsilon[t+1]}

where r is a positive constant and \eqn{\epsilon \sim iid(0, \sigma^2)}{\epsilon - iid(0, \sigma^2)}.
Taking expectations on both sides yields

\deqn{E_t[B_{t+1}] = (1+r)B_t}{E[B[t+1]]= (1+r)*B[t]}

where \eqn{E_t}{E} is the expectation operator. The expected growth rate of the bubble is (1+r).
