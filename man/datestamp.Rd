\title{Date stamping periods of exuberance}
\usage{
datestamp(x, y, option = c("gsadf", "sadf"), min_duration = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "radf", that contains}

\item{y}{an object of class "cv".}

\item{option}{whether to plot badf-tstat with the adf-cv or bsadf-tsat with the badf-cv.
The default value is "badf".}

\item{min_duration}{the minimum duration of an explosive period for it to be reported. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of values for each explosive sub-period, giving the origin and termination dates as well as the number of periods explosive behaviour lasts.
}
\description{
\code{datestamp} computes the origination, termination and duration of episodes during which
the time series display explosive dynamics.
}
\details{
Setting \code{min_duration} allows temporary spikes above the critical value sequence to
be removed.
